For example, aspirin is approved for reduction of pain and fever. Clinical testing has shown in can be repurposed to reduce the incidence of heart disease, as well as some cancers. CureAccelerator is designed to facilitate the investigation of existing drugs, devices and other science and medicine that has the potential to be repurposed to meet the needs of patients and their physicians worldwide.</p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Why is repurposing research important?</h5> <p>There are thousands of diseases waiting for a treatment or cure, and the standard “new discovery” pharmaceutical and device treatment development system is unable to solve them all. Repurposing research is affordable to conduct and any validated treatments can move quickly, and often inexpensively, into clinical care. Learn more at DrugRepurposing101.</p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Can you provide some examples of repurposing successes?</h5> <p>There are hundreds of examples of repurposing successes in medicine, including repurposing aspirin for heart disease and cancer, and repurposing the antihypertensive sildenafil as a treatment for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. <a target=_blank href="//www.cureswithinreach.org/research/search-complete-research/success-stories">Click here to see our Cures Within Reach successes</a></p> </div> <div class="question-group last"> <h5>If repurposing is such a great idea, why haven’t I heard about it before? </h5> <p>Lots of people are working on repurposing, including many pharmaceutical, device and diagnostic companies that are trying the repurpose their own assets. Many Patient Advocacy Groups and Voluntary Health Organizations are beginning to include repurposing in their research portfolio. Governmental agencies in the US and the UK have programs to repurpose shelved pharmaceutical company compounds.</p> <p>In the past, repurposing has not been used as fully as it might be to benefit patients for two primary reasons:</p> <p><strong>Financial:</strong> Repurposed therapies, especially the repurposing of inexpensive generic drugs and devices, while often effective for patients, do not present an attractive business case for companies or investors.</p> <p><strong>Cultural:</strong> Scientists are trained to pursue that which is NEW (de-novo research), that can lead to highly ranked publications, and longer term funding. Philanthropies and their science advisors have historically followed this lead, and selected and funded primarily de-novo research. This paradigm is starting to shift as patient outcomes are moving to center stage, and awareness around the speed, reduced cost and safety of repurposing grows.</p> </div> </div> <div id=cureaccelerator class=question-container> <header> <h3 class=sidebar-content--title>CureAccelerator</h3> </header> <div class=question-group> <h5>Privacy/Terms of Use</h5> <p>You will be able to choose what elements of your profile and your participation are visible to the public. <a href="../privacy/">Learn more about our Privacy Disclosure and Terms of Use here.</a></p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Who manages CureAccelerator? </h5> <p>CureAccelerator is founded and managed by Cures Within Reach, a non-profit organization devoted to improving patient quality and length of life through repurposing. <a target=_blank href="//www.cureswithinreach.org">Learn more here.</a></p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Why should I become a user of CureAccelerator?</h5> <p>Each person who joins and contributes to CureAccelerator helps us drive more treatments to more patients more quickly through repurposing.

How can we benefit from this site?</h5> <p>CureAccelerator can help you find more repurposing research that has the potential to make a difference for the patients you care about most. On CureAccelerator, you can expand your reach by connecting with those you don’t yet know: a global network of researchers who are focused on and passionate about repurposing, individual donors who support repurposing and your disease or patient population interests, and other organizations that share your goals. You can also integrate your own project solicitation, review and funding decision processes. Based on your organizational needs and policies, we have different ways we can work together for research sourcing and grant management – <a href="../contact/">please contact us to discuss.</a></p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Who can fund this research and how are funds pledged?</h5> <p>Non-profit organizations, individual funders, government and industry groups can support research through CureAccelerator. Funders can pledge funds in the Project Proposal Summary phase, and can choose to support a portion of a project’s budget, or the complete budget. Funders can find other funders on CureAccelerator and decide to work together to fund a project.</p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>What happens after a project is selected for funding?</h5> <p>After a proposed project passes scientific review and receives commitments for funding, an agreement is reached with the research institution or company sponsoring the research. Depending on the funder preferences, either Cures Within Reach or the funder will manage the grant post-award, including payment schedules and regular reporting. Details will be arranged offline between Cures Within Reach, the research institution or company sponsoring the research, and the funders.</p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Is there a cost for funders to join CureAccelerator?</h5> <p>There is no cost for funders to join and participate in CureAccelerator. In fact, funders often reduce their costs finding and funding research through CureAccelerator, due in part to the CureAccelerator scientific review process that includes budget review, and due in part to CureAccelerator’s established relationships with research institutions that share the desire to keep budgets as low as possible. <a href="../contact/">Please contact us for further information</a></p> </div> <div class="question-group last"> <h5>How is CureAccelerator funded?</h5> <p>CureAccelerator is funded through foundation and corporate support and sponsorship, as well as through its research co-funding model.

CureAccelerator also supports research testing improvements to an existing treatment protocol. In addition to clinical trials, repurposing projects may be last pre-clinical research leading directly to a clinical trial. CureAccelerator funders will consider supporting certain foundational research, such as gene sequencing or biomarker development, when it is critical to moving repurposing clinical trials forward as quickly as possible and with a higher likelihood of success.</p> <p>Proposals should target a disease, condition or side effect where one or more of the following is true:</p> <ul> <li>It does not currently have sufficiently effective treatment</li> <li>There is an effective treatment that is very expensive</li> <li>There is an effective treatment with a significant side effect profile</li> <li>There is an effective treatment for only a portion of the patient population</li> </ul> <p>Each CureAccelerator project must have the potential to create significant patient impact in the next 2-4 years, either through off-label use, or through larger clinical trials leading to commercialization and marketing approvals by the FDA or other regulatory agencies.</p> <p>CureAccelerator projects minimize costs and timelines in order to accomplish the purpose of the project, maximizing return on investment and ensuring that as many repurposing projects as possible can be funded.</p> </div> <div class=question-group> <h5>Who reviews the posted research and how are those reviews completed?</h5> <p>Scientists and clinicians with repurposing expertise and with relevant disease/therapy expertise review research proposed within CureAccelerator. These advisors include CureAccelerator’s standing Science Advisory Board members, and independent scientists and clinicians with area of expertise in the treatment, disease, or patient population, some of whom are recommended by the Principal Investigator (the researcher in charge of the project), proposing the research. A summary of completed reviews is sent to the Principal Investigator and select portions of the reviews may be publicly visible.</p> </div> <div class="question-group last"> <h5>I am a researcher or clinician with a repurposing idea-what should I do on CureAccelerator?</h5> <p><a target=_blank href="app.cureaccelerator.org/sign_up">Join our global community!</a> First, decide if your idea is ready for public disclosure, or if you need to contact your tech transfer or business development area to decide if you should protect any intellectual property in your idea.
