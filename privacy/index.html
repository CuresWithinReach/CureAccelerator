Our goal is to provide a platform for stakeholders who want to share their knowledge and resources to create repurposed treatments for unsolved diseases. We know our success in achieving this goal depends on a shared belief in community, transparency, philanthropy, science, clinical care and empathy. Being transparent about medical research science and finance is not for everyone, and we strive, with full transparency, to outline the benefits and risks of being part of this site, including those related to privacy.</p> <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information CureAccelerator collects from individuals who have registered to join CureAccelerator (“Users”) and how it is shared and is not shared with other Users and with third parties.</p> <p>We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy and terms on this website. We encourage Users to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p> <p>What kind of information we collect:</p> <p><strong>Shared Data</strong></p> <p>Some of the information that Users provide about themselves may be shared with the CureAccelerator community and others (“Shared Data”). Examples of Shared Data that Users may submit at the Site, including through their profile (“User Profile”), may include:</p> <ul> <li>Biographical information, e.g. photograph, biography, gender, age, location (city, state and country), general notes;</li> <li>Health information;</li> <li>Treatment information, e.g. treatment start dates, stop dates, dosages, side effects, treatment evaluations;</li> <li>Symptom information, e.g. severity, duration;</li> <li>Science information, e.g. research data and insights, research project ideas, scientific reviews of research;</li> <li>Clinical information, e.g. non-confidential clinical protocols, on-label and off-label treatment recommendations, research project ideas, clinical reviews of research;</li> <li>Financial information, e.g. funding pledges and commitments, historical personal or organizational financial information;</li> <li>Information shared via free text fields, e.g. discussion forums, Requests for Proposals, Letters of Intent, Full Grants, Reviews, surveys, online postings, annotations, journals, feeds and other text fields and documents; and</li> <li>Connections to other people on the Site, e.g. invitations to join, to review, to communicate, including emails, text messages and other forms of online communication.</li> </ul> <p>In the course of using the Site, Users may share information that could be used to reasonably identify them (“Personal Information”), including name, photograph, location and email address. When a User chooses to share Personal Information via a free text field and photos or images, the information shall be treated as Shared Data.</p> <p><strong> Restricted Data</strong></p> <p>Some of the information that Users enter into certain fields when registering to use or using the Site will not be shared (“Restricted Data”). A User may opt to share is or her Restricted Data with other Users. The type of Restricted Data that Users may submit at the Site may include:</p> <ul> <li>Name, as collected as part of registration or in a User’s Account Information;</li> <li>Email address, as collected and verified as part of registration or in a User’s Account Information;</li> <li>Password, as collected as part of registration or in a User’s Account Information;</li> <li>Mailing address; and</li> <li>Private messages.</li> </ul> <p>When a User enters Personal Information, including name and email address, as part of registering to use CureAccelerator, that Personal Information is treated as Restricted Data.</p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>A cookie is a small data file that often includes an anonymous, unique token, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and may be stored on your computer’s hard drive. Two types of cookies are required to use the Site:</p> <ul> <li>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain only until you log out of the website or exit your web browser. Session Cookies do not store any Personal Information, only a unique visitor ID number that may be used to ensure Users are properly authenticated and can view site information.</li> <li>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer, even after you leave the Site. Persistent Cookies also do not store any Personal Information. Persistent Cookies store preferences that should persist from visit to visit, like “Remember Me,” and a unique token to enable us to understand how Users use the Site (“Site Usage”).</li> </ul> <p><strong>How your data is used</strong></p> <p>Users should expect that every piece of information they submit (even if it is not currently displayed), except for Restricted Data, may be shared with the community and others. Users are encouraged to share information.</p> <p>There are instances where both Shared Data and Restricted Data, including Personal Information, may be used and disclosed including, but not limited to, the following:</p> <ul> <li>CureAccelerator uses Shared Data, Restricted Data, and Site Usage internally, as needed, for research, for maintenance and operation of the Site, and to create the best possible tools and functionality for patients.</li> <li>CureAccelerator may use a User’s data in the case of an emergency or other circumstance that we determine requires a member of the management team to directly contact the User.</li> <li>CureAccelerator may share or disclose a User’s data where required by law or to comply with legal process.</li> <li>In the event CureAccelerator goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another organization, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, the Shared Data and Restricted Data, including Personal Information, might be among the assets transferred. Users will be notified via this Site of any such change in ownership or control of Personal Information.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How Shared Data is Used</strong></p> <p>Shared Data is viewable via User Profile and through aggregated reports that could be made available to other CureAccelerator Users. In some instances, portions of this Shared Data is also viewable to those not registered to join CureAccelerator (“Non-Users”). We report publicly Shared Data in aggregate, such as the number of users or projects or dollars in funding. If a User chooses to designate his or her Profile as “Public” (see Privacy Settings below), that Shared Data can also be viewed by Non-Users and linked with aggregated reports.</p> <p>In addition to serving the individual needs of our Users, CureAccelerator is interested in better understanding how repurposing research is viewed and managed. CureAccelerator may provide Shared Data, in individual and aggregate format, to third parties for use in scientific research and market research. When providing this information, CureAccelerator usually removes Users’ Restricted Data to reduce the likelihood of identification prior to sharing information.</p> <p>CureAccelerator might provide a voluntary opt-in service to Users that would allow third parties to directly communicate with Users through our system.</p> <p>CureAccelerator may also periodically ask Users to complete short surveys about their experiences (including questions about products and services). Survey responses are analyzed, combined with Users’ Shared Data and may be shared with third parties. User participation in these surveys is not required, and refusal to do so will not impact a User’s experience on the Site.</p> <p>The information CureAccelerator reports includes, but is not limited to, all of the information about the User and/or free text or images on the forums, RFPs, LOI, FGs reviews or evaluations, which may include Shared Data. In addition, certain areas within our Site may be provided with the support of third parties, who may have access to Shared Data.</p> <p>CureAccelerator, like most Internet communities, is a public forum, and Users acknowledge and accept that any information shared through free text or images might be connected to Users’ Shared Data (which may be shared with, sold to, or displayed for others). For example, if a User puts his or her name (or other Personal Information) into a free text field like the biography, forum, LOI, RFP, grant, journals or annotations, the User should know this information may be included in what is shared with, displayed for, or sold to Partners.</p> <p><strong>How Restricted Data is Used</strong></p> <p>Restricted Data is not automatically shared with, sold to, or displayed for other Users or third parties. Specific instances where Restricted Data may be used or provided to other Users or third parties include, but are not limited to, the following:</p> <ul> <li>If a User provides a date of birth, the User’s current age might be viewable via User Profile;</li> If a User registers as a Funder, Patients, Researcher or Clinician, or future User Role to be defined, the User’s full name and affiliation may be viewable via User Profile; <li>If a User chooses the Public privacy setting (see below), CureAccelerator and others may use public profiles in reports, conference presentations, media mentions, etc.;</li> <li>If a User agrees to participate in a media interview (as arranged by CureAccelerator), CureAccelerator will share the contact information the User provides (i.e. name, email, telephone) with the reporter for the purpose of conducting an interview;</li> <li>If a User OPTS IN to a public registry (e.g. the CureAccelerator Public Registry), CureAccelerator will display the User’s name and some Shared Data and/or Restricted Data as part of this registry (which is viewable by anyone on the Internet);</li> <li>If a User explicitly opts in to have their Restricted Data shared with a third party, CureAccelerator will share the information as instructed by the User (e.g. co-registration with a non-profit);</li> <li>If a User makes a request, CureAccelerator may use Restricted Data, including sharing the User’s Restricted Data with software/service vendors, for the purpose of fulfilling the request. Examples include requesting to receive the company newsletter via email, requesting an email response from the CureAccelerator support team, and requesting an item be mailed to the User’s address.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Privacy settings</strong></p> <p>There are various privacy levels a User may choose for participation at CureAccelerator. We may add, subtract or change privacy levels at our option. Some of these privacy levels are:</p> <ul> <li>Public: Non-Users and Users can see User Profile and user name, but only CureAccelerator Users can contact you through CureAccelerator.</li> <li>Visible: Only CureAccelerator Users can see User Profile and user name, and can contact you through CureAccelerator;</li> <li>Alias: Only CureAccelerator Users can see user name but cannot see certain aspects of User Profile, and may or may not contact you directly through CureAccelerator</li> </ul> <p>Users may change their privacy level at any time. Public profiles may be indexed or stored by Internet search engines (e.g. Google) or other independent sites, which means a User’s Shared Data, including any Personal Information shared, may come up in the search results by anyone on the Internet, even after switching privacy levels.</p> <p>Because the value of CureAccelerator is in sharing one’s knowledge, resources and experiences to help others, we hope that Users feel comfortable enough to make their profiles as public as possible.</p> <p><strong>Other security issues</strong></p> <p>CureAccelerator cannot guarantee the identity of any other Users with whom a User may interact in the course of using the Site or who may have access to a User’s Shared Data. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the authenticity of any data that Users may provide about themselves.</p> <p>Finally, Users should know that CureAccelerator takes reasonable technical precautions to help keep User data secure, but cannot assure data security. Risks and benefits</p> <p>While our goal is to help create repurposed therapies, there are no certain benefits to using this website. No project is guaranteed funding and no funding is guaranteed to secure a project. There is no guarantee that any research proposed or funded through this site will create a new treatment or cure for any disease. This site is not intended to provide any medical recommendations. You should always discuss medical decisions with your healthcare providers.</p> <p>There are also no known risks to using this website, but there is a possibility that users may feel uncomfortable sharing certain information online.</p> <p>It is possible that a User could be identified using information shared on CureAccelerator (and/or in conjunction with other data sources). A User could be discriminated against or experience repercussions as a result of the information shared. For example, it is possible that employers, insurance companies, or others may discriminate based on health information that is supplied. It is also possible that a clinician or researcher could be experience repercussions from colleagues or employers based on information provided on CureAccelerator.</p> <p>Users should understand that anyone can register as a User on CureAccelerator and view the Shared Data in the system. If you are reading this Privacy Policy because you have access to the Personal Information of a Site participant, we urge you to recognize and fulfill your responsibility to protect the privacy of that person.</p> <p>In using the Site, Users are free to skip any non-required questions or data fields that make them feel uncomfortable. Users are also free to stop using this service at any time. If a User chooses to deactivate his/her account, CureAccelerator will endeavor not display or sell the data in that account after the date of deactivation. However, the User’s data will remain in the system for auditing and research purposes.</p> <p>Researchers and clinicians who propose Repurposing Research on CureAccelerator should take whatever steps are necessary to properly protect the intellectual property or other confidential information inherent in the Repurposing Research. Placing the information on CureAccelerator may constitute a public disclosure, which could have an impact on future intellectual property protectability.</p> <p><strong>Safe Harbor Compliance</strong></p> <p>CureAccelerator complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union User countries and Switzerland.

That may sound like a paradox (not to be confused with a “pair of docs”), but we believe that Transparency is necessary to maximize the ability of Repurposing Research to drive more treatments to more patients more quickly.</p> <p>There are thousands of generic drugs, devices and nutriceuticals that can be repurposed, in their current dosage and delivery form, to help improve the quality and length of patients’ lives, and to reduce healthcare costs. Unfortunately, there is often no economic incentive for any company or individual to finance the research that would prove these repurposed uses. Proving a generic drug that is inexpensive and widely available could help a rare disease is a noble endeavor, but unlikely to create a financial return on investment, even if that clinical trial proof led only to off-label use, without the additional time and costs involved in securing regulatory marketing approval.</p> <p>In addition, it is often challenging for researchers and clinicians to disclose their Repurposing Research ideas in public, because they might lose the opportunity to protect intellectual property, secure a grant, publish a paper, increase their practice or move up in the academic ranks. These challenges can often delay or discourage proving these ideas in a way that they can move forward to patients.</p> <p>CureAccelerator and our supporters believe that the more transparent and altruistic we are, the greater the impact on patients. So, we encourage our Users to be as open, transparent, altruistic, giving, participatory, positive, forthcoming, supportive and connected as possible. Our guiding vision is a medical research and treatment development system through which every possible existing compound, device and treatment resource is used to make patients healthier, in which diverse stakeholders join together to create uncommon results.</p> <p>Your participation on CureAccelerator can be the catalyst to correct a rampant global healthcare problem-the lack of treatments for unsolved diseases. We believe that CureAccelerator can help drive Repurposing Research in a transformative, rapid, affordable and effective way. It only works if we all participate in this together, as transparently as possible.</p> </div> </div> </section> </div> <hr class=page-section--divider> <section role=region aria-labelledby=featured-content class=page-section--container> <h2 class=title>Get started today with CureAccelerator</h2> <ul class=button-list> <li><a class="button button--primary" href="https://app.cureaccelerator.org/registration">Sign Up</a></li> <li><a class="button button--secondary" href="../faq/">Learn More</a></li> </ul> </section> </main> <footer role="page footer" class=page-footer> <div class=footer-container> <div class=footer--left> <ul> <li>The CureAccelerator platform was built with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</li> </ul> </div> <div class=footer--right> <ul> <li>CureAccelerator™</li> <li>All Rights Reserved</li> <li><a href="./">Privacy/Terms of Use</a></li> <li><a href="../contact/">Contact</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
